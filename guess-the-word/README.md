Here I brought a super simple version of Wordle. My objective in this project was to implement some code
to consume data from a raw .txt file and use some basic functions to randomly choose a word in a list of
5-letters words and allow the user to try to guess that word letter by letter.
<br><br>

# ðŸ“‹ Features ðŸ“‹
1. Choose 5-letters words randomly
2. Asures only 1 letter in the guesses
3. Case insensitive
4. Score system
5. Used letters list for each word
